    title: "Idempotent: API design must follow idempotent."
    message: |
      "**API design must follow several idempotent scenarios**
      
      **Idempotence:** In the HTTP/1.1 specification, *idempotence* is defined as follows:
      
      Methods can also have the property of *idempotence* in that (aside from error or expiration issues)
      the side-effects of **N > 0** identical requests is the same as for a single request.
      
      By definition, the idempotent nature of the HTTP method means that a single request and multiple identical 
      requests for a resource should have the same side effects.
      
      - **(1)** The query interface (GET) for resources is not involved.
      - **(2)** Resource modification interfaces (PUT and PATCH) are recommended to support idempotence.
      - **(3)** Creating a class interface (POST) is difficult to implement idempotence and is not required.
      - **(4)** The DELETE interface is recommended to be idempotent."
    task: During the testing idempotency must be evaluated for GET, DELETE, PUT and PATCH HTTP methods.
    option: Recommend
    severity: high
