    title: "Open API type: The API design meets the open type definition requirements."
    message: |
      Open APIs are APIs that can be invoked by tenants or cloud services using tenant credentials.
      Such APIs are open to all scenarios and can be directly accessed by tenants. 
      Open APIs must provide developer suites such as documents, API Explorer, SDK, CLI, and examples.
      In principle, the console can be built based on Open APIs.
    task: All API calls described in OpenAPI specification must be published and directly accessible by end users.
    option: Mandatory
