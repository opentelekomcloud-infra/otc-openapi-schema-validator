    title: "Flow control design: Flow control must be considered during API design."
    message: |
      **When resources or services become bottlenecks, the service needs to start the flow control protection mechanism**
      
      The public cloud API flow control is hierarchical. The service needs to provide the local flow control capability.
      When the threshold is exceeded, the service starts the local flow control. If the service provides external interfaces,
      the API-GW can perform outer flow control. The API-GW is responsible for outer flow control. 
      
      The service needs to provide the API flow control baseline value in typical scenarios.
    task: Test whether respective amount of API calls can be triggered within defined API threshold.
    option: Mandatory
