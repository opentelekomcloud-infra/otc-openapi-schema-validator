    title: "Compatibility: The interfaces must be compatible"
    message: |
      APIs are external facades and cannot be modified once released. Compatibility is a top priority in API design. When modifying an API, you must consider the impact of the released API on users.
      After the APIs of each service are officially released, any modification of the APIs must be compatible with the APIs of the earlier version. If the API compatibility cannot be ensured, the APIs can be added or the API-TMG can be used for exception review
      Acceptable compatibility interface change scenarios:

      - Adding an API
      - Optional attributes are added to the request message body.
      - Add attributes to the response message body for resource requests.
      - Interface changes for fixing security vulnerabilities
      - Rectify the bug that an incorrect response is returned for a request. After the change, a success response is returned.
      - Add a response header.

      Unacceptable API change scenarios:
 
      - The API is deleted.
      - The API request or response parameter is deleted.
      - Adding Mandatory Request Parameters to APIs
      - The API request or response parameter types are incompatible.
      - The value range of the API request parameter is narrowed down.
      - Some enumerated values (enum) of API request parameters of the enumerated type are deleted or changed.
      - The API response status code is deleted or changed.
      - Fixed bug: A request was previously successful but now returned an error.
      - Changes the semantic meaning of an attribute. For example, dhcp_enable indicates whether to enable DHCP. In the current version, dhcp_enable indicates whether to enable static IP address injection.
      - Modify or delete a response header.
      - Response code when the change is successful.
      - Modify the operationId of the interface.

    task: Any API change must be evaluated against these rules. If evaluation identifies one of the unacceptable API change scenario then API change must not be released under these conditions
    option: Mandatory
