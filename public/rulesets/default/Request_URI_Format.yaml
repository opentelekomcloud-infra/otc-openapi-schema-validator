    title: The request line must be designed in the format defined by the Uniform Resource Identifier.
    message: |
      The request line is mainly a requirement for a uniform resource identifier (URI).
      A URI is one of the most intuitive content for users to view an interface.
      The definition of a URI must be designed according to the specified format. (OpenStack or community APIs are subject to the native definition.)
      The format of the Uniform Resource Identifier is:
      /{version}/{resources}.
      For APIs that have been released in history, the resource identifier can be defined as follows:
      /{version}/{project_id}/{resources}
      Note: version indicates the interface version, for example, v1. In the inventory resource ID, project_id and tenant_id indicate the project ID.

    message: |
      Do not use unnecessary abbreviations in URIs (Unless the abbreviation is commonly used in the industry and accompanied by proof of its origin, abbreviations without clear evidence of their source are not permitted.). Ensure that the names of URIs are "Know the meanings of Wangwen" to avoid understanding obstacles. Do not use unusual abbreviations. Use correct words and words with the same meaning across APIs. Helps developers understand APIs.

    title: If a URI contains special characters for special purposes, escape the characters (% hexadecimal code).
    message: |
      Note: Some characters have special meanings or are reserved by the system and are easily blocked by the network firewall.
      As a result, URI invoking does not take effect. Therefore, it is not recommended that you use characters in URIs. If necessary, replace them with escape codes:
      . – Reserved in the path component
      .. – Reserved in the path component
      # – Reserved as the fragment delimiter
      ? – Reserved as the query-string delimiter
      ; – Reserved as the params delimiter
      : – Reserved to delimit the scheme, user/password, and host/port components
      $, + – Reserved

    message: |
      Note: Cloud Service APIs follow the Restful style. The URI is designed according to the standard format (URI-010-01-2507-2507-M).
      URI design should be simple and remove unnecessary redundant information.
      New APIs must be implemented according to the specifications. Existing APIs that involve compatibility changes can remain unchanged.
      Example: Excessive fields in URI: GET /v1/app/openapi/cmdb/business/get-business-list, the fields app, openapi, and get-business-list
      in the URI are redundant and can be simplified to GET /v1/cmdb/businesses
