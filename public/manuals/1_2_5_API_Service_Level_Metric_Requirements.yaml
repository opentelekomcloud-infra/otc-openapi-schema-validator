    message: |
      **The response time for an API call does not exceed 3s.**
      
      - **(1)** The time of 3s (referring to the peer vendor) does not include the network consumption from the user end to the server.
      Specifies the response time for the gateway to invoke the API backend service after an API request arrives at the gateway.
      Start from the time when the gateway sends a request to the backend to the time when the gateway receives a result from the backend.
      
      - **(2)** It is recommended that each API provided by the service provide a baseline time consumption in typical scenarios.
    option: Mandatory

    title: "Availability requirements"
    message: |
      **Each API must design an availability value.**
      
      - **(1)** API Unavailability Definition: If a user receives a response indicating a server error for a request,      
      (HTTP code 500 InternalError, HTTP code 503 ServiceUnavailable).
      If the server error is reported after three retry attempts, the system is unavailable for 1 minute.

      - **(2)** Definition of API availability: For a user in a billing period, the API availability is calculated as follows:
      100% â€“ Unavailability time/Total service time.
      
      - **(3)** The availability of different services varies according to the external commitment.
      The API availability value is defined based on the service attributes of the service.
      For details, see the service commitment.

    title: "Throughput requirements"
    message: |
      **The number of requests that can be processed by the interface per unit time must be considered during API design.**
      
      - **(1)** In the API design phase, consider the processing capability of the API in a unit time.
      This indicator represents the maximum capability that the service can bear. Refer to the domain benchmark.
